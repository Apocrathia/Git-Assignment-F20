	\paragraph*{About Me}
		
		
		
	I am just starting my PhD in Security program. My goal for this course is to get into a research frame of mind, learn the modern tricks and tips, and help refine my dissertation topic.
	
	
	I am really interested in learning more about zotero and latex. I gained some experience with zotero last year, but previously I've only been aware of manual tracking and editing. It's nice to know that technology has evolved quite a bit with research and data management.
	

	I have done stand-up comedy twice. My set was mostly cybersecurity related and I received a number of laughs. I'm not sure if my comedy career will continue, but my career will definitely be full of comedy.
