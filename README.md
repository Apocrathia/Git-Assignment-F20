Jordan: FYI, you need permissions for the project before you can do a "push". Hope that helps.

How do you update the .pdf file? -Cassandra

Folks! I tried to use CLI to only push my three edited files but it replaced the entire repository with my files. I had a backup of entire repository from half an hour earlier, I returned all your files with most recent edits as there were before. There was no edit for the files during that time; therefore, all the edits are remained as uploaded by other students. I sincerely appologize for any inconvinence. Best, -Maximus
