\subsection{About Me}
	
This will be my 2nd semester as a PhD student at UCCS, and hopefully, the first without any global pandemics impeding my ability to finish the semester. My major is in security, and I am focused in the areas of artificial intelligence and software security.

\medskip

I have a passion for making things. Here are some of the personal projects that I am continuously working on.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item {Electronics} - After my master's degree, I became obsessed with IoT and home automation, and have created multiple devices based upon the ESP8266 platform for use within my home.
    \item {Software Development} - Also pertaining to home automation, I have been an avid contributor to the Home Assistant \cite{home_assistant} project, and post my own configuration to GitHub, which is referenced within the Home Assistant documentation as an example for other users. \cite{home_assistant_config}
    \item {Network \& Systems Engineering} - I actively maintain a home lab that I can rapidly test and develop new software and systems in. My lab environment currently consists of a 4-node VMware vSphere cluster and a 12-node Kubernetes cluster.
    \item {3D Printing} - During my master's degree, I bought my first 3D printer while developing IoT hardware. This has turned into a passion of it's own, as I have now branched into CAD and have even started selling my own designs online. \cite{etsy_shop}
\end{enumerate}
In addition to my passion for making things, I also have been a lifelong aviation enthusiast, and I am currently working towards my commercial pilots license.
