I am a first year PhD student in the computer science program. Professionally, I work in computer security specializing in offensive security, such as penetration testing, exploit development, vulnerability research, etc. My current academic research interests relate to the application of machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques, such as artificial neural networks and deep learning, to detect intrusions and anomalous behavior on a network or system. I am also interested in various other areas of computer security, so I am expecting my research interests to shift until I get settled into the program.
