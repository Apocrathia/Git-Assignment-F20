\subsection{James Bond(Peng)}
Before I study in UCCS, I was security solution architect and software engineer. I worked for Newegg, and Hewlett-Packard. I developed security for BIOS (basic input output system) and firmware in laptops, developed infrastructure security for fraud detection systems and search systems in E-Commerce. I also served in military, for cyber operation and radar systems for Coast Guard. I studied electrical engineering and energy systems in undergraduate and high school.

My recent research interest now is signal intelligence (SIGINT), and advanced persistent threats (APTs) in embedded systems. Fields I've done are: 

\begin{itemize}
\item adversarial machine learning (artificial intelligence, intrusion detection and operation systems)
\item lightweight provenance (operating systems)
\item trust execution and zero trust architecture (cloud, privacy and cryptography)
\item fuzzing for satellite embedded systems (vulnerability scanning, protocol state machine, flight software)
\end{itemize}

I like not only coding, reading but also sports. I did fencing in elementary school and, after high school, Greco-Roman wrestling, boxing, cage fight, and surfing (both long board and short board). Now in the mountains of Colorado Springs, I swim instead. I am glad to learn from you guys.
