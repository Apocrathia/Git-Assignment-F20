\subsection{James Bond(Peng)}
Before I study in UCCS, I was security solution architect and software engineer. I worked for Newegg, and Hewlett-Packard. I developed security for BIOS (basic input output system) and firmware in laptops, developed infrastructure security for fraud detection systems and search systems in E-Commerce. I also served in military, for cyber operation and radar systems for Coast Guard. I studied electrical engineering and energy systems in undergraduate and high school.

My recent research interest now is signal intelligence (SIGINT), and advanced persistent threats (APTs) in embedded systems. Fields I've done are: 

\begin{itemize}
\item adversarial machine learning (artificial intelligence, intrusion detection and operation systems)
\item lightweight provenance (operating systems)
\item trust execution and zero trust architecture (cloud, privacy and cryptography)
\item fuzzing for satellite embedded systems (vulnerability scanning, protocol state machine, flight software)
\end{itemize}

I like not only coding, reading but also sports. I did fencing in elementary school and, after high school, Greco-Roman wrestling, boxing, cage fight, and surfing (both long board and short board). Now in the mountains of Colorado Springs, I swim instead. I am glad to learn from you guys.

\textbf{Question for James Peng from Constance Hendrix}:  Hi again, James.  I saw you served in the Coast Guard as a Cyber Operator -- very exciting!  Where have you been stationed?

\textbf{Answer from James Peng to Constance Hendrix}:  I was not cyber operator but cyber security specialist for intelligence and counterintelligence against China, stationed in Taipei----a place near to Tokyo----very far away from here Colorado Springs. Thank you for emailing me previously; because of that, I also found your Linkedin and already sent you a friend request. Please accept it when you have time. Your career background is also very exciting to me, too: My uncle worked at US Air Force Intelligence and Personnel for his whole career until retirement----from US-Taiwan Command, German 7455th Tactical Intelligence Wing, Virginia, and NORAD----, like you. And your current employer BAH happens to be my dream company/ firm has my dream position. I hope to join your company as a vulnerability security engineer after my PhD. Should be very fun!   

\textbf{Question for James Peng from Lori Babyak}:  Hi James. Thanks for fixing my problems in Babyak.txt - I appreciate it!  You've done some interesting work - I hope you can explain it to me sometime.

\textbf{Answer from James Peng to Lori Babyak}:  Hi, sure thing, anytime and anything. Feel free to ask me on any channel. Thank you for asking me question. By the way your background is also very very cool; not gonna lie. I feel all my classmates are extraordinary, wow!

\textbf{Question from Maximus to James Bond}: Hi James, You have broad and diverse research interests. These are all great topics; but can I ask you why you decided to focus more on SIGINT and APTs for your research among all these topics you studied?
